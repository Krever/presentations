### Communication goal

<img src="resources/comm-model-3.mermaid.png">

_What you say_ and _What they hear_ don't matter in the end

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers</span>

##### Problem 1
## Estimates

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

### Is this a communication concern?

<pre style="width: 50%">
Q: When will this be done?
A: In around a week
</pre>

<div class="fragment">
    <small>What they understood: <i>It will be in prod for all the users in 1 week</i></small>
    <small>What you wanted to say: <i>I will open a PR in 1 week</i></small>
</div>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

### The goal

Provide a number with **the same meaning** for both sides

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

#### The most important question

> Why do you need it?

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

#### Reasons for providing estimates

* Promise to regulators
* Promise to users
* Catching market opportunity
* Internal planning
* Prioritization
* ...
* **None**

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

#### You can't communicate effectively without understaning the other side

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

### What to explicitly mention
<small>When estimating a release date</small>

<small>

* Scope - what will be released and to whom <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Num of dev-days - how much work-time it will take <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Uncertainty factor - how confident we are about the work <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Assumed dev assignment - how many devs will work on this <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"  data-fragment-index="4" -->
* Assumed dev availability - how much time a single dev can devote <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"  data-fragment-index="4" -->
* End result - what will be delivered <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"  data-fragment-index="5" -->
* Final date - by what date we expect the release <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"  data-fragment-index="5" -->

<span style="font-size: 0.5em;color: gray">Real estimate of mine with small edits</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

### Estimate vs commitment

Be clear

<div style="font-size: 0.5em;color: gray">
Estimate = Predicition<br/>
Commitment = Promise
</div>

Words matter

##### Problem 2

## During implementation

<small>Code & work coordination</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>

### Business discussions

<small>
Part of the job is to be understood.

Limit the amount of information.

Forbidden words: PR, commit, branch.
</small>

++++

Adjust content to the audience

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>

### Code comments

It's a message into the future

* Imagine what information might be needed  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Provide historical context - "why not what" <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Humor is valuable <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->


++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>

### Error messages

Another message into the future.

Imagine receiving it and what might be useful then.

<br/>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0"><code style="text-align: center" class="language-text">Operation unsupported</code></pre>
<p style="margin: 0">vs.</p>
<pre style="margin-top: 0"><code style="text-align: center" class="language-text">Can't update address of an inactive user</code></pre>

++++

### Leave breadcrumbs behind

<small>Pieces of context that will help in future investigations</small>

<img src="resources/breadcrumbs.mermaid.png">

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>

### Build in the open

You can never know who might be interested, who might be affected, and if it's not you who misses some context

<span style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">We will talk about this more later</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation » build in the open</span>

### Keep people in the loop

If you're irreplaceable, you've failed at your job.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>
### Coordinating releases

<div class="container">
    <div class="col" style="font-size: 0.7em">
        It can be really complicated when multiple parties are involved.
        <small>Mobile, backend, marketing, legal, operations, etc.</small>

##### Problem 3
## Pull requests: Author

Goal: Get your PRs reviewed


++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author</span>

### Find reviewers

Concrete people, not groups. <br>
As many as you need, but **not more** <br>
<span style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">Diffusion of responsibility<br>
    The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help.</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author</span>

### Put a deadline

Explicit date by which you want to merge

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author</span>

### Make it reviewer-friendly

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author » Make it reviewer-friendly</span>

## Make it small

<span style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">Hehe</span>

++++

### When small is not an option

* description - what the PR is about <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* highlights - the most important places to look at <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* remaining TODOs - to know what is not done yet <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author » Make it reviewer-friendly</span>

### No force-push

<small>⚔️ rebase vs merge ⚔️</small>

### Don't be a jerk

<small>

* propose solutions (e.g. new names) <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* offer help (e.g. pair programming) <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* show empathy (e.g. no one wants to fix stuff ad infinitum) <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* pick your battles (not every issue is important, perfect doesn't exist) <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->

### Repeat, repeat, repeat

People will forget, miss messages or misinterpret. This is normal.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication </span>

### How to get a response

* Target your messages
* Explain why you need something
* Explain when you need it

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication » How to get a response</span>

### Target your messages

No explicit `@mention` - no response.
<div style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">
    Diffusion of responsibility again<br>
    Ping someone even if you're not sure if they can help.
</div>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication » How to get a response</span>

### Explain why you need something

Giving _any_ explanation changes the situation diametrically.

<span style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">Xerox Study by Ellen Langer</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication » How to get a response</span>

### Explain when you need it

People will try to deliver by that date. <br>
Smaller chance of landing in "later" bucket.

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Give the responses you want to get

<small>

* if you don't know the answer but you know someone who might - ping them <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* if you don't have time - say this <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* if you plan to look at it later on - say this <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* if you started looking at the problem at it might take time - say this <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->

</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Adjust the tone

😊 Humans like smiles 😊

But over-enthusiasm can be worse than grumpiness.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Adjust the tone

😡 Don't be a pushover 😡

Some messages need to be harsh

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Adjust the formatting

Messages should be easy to scan.
<small>People are busy, most of them won't read a wall of text.</small>

* Put TL;DR at the top <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Bolden the essence <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Use bullet points <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Don't over-do it <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Call or message

<img src="resources/quick-call-meme.jpeg">

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Call or message

Meetings are costly, inconvenient, annoying.<br>
And effective.

<small>Heuristic: threads with more than 10 messages sent in an hour should be a call.</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Be gentle with `@pings`

Use as little as possible but not less.

When pinging from long thread - summarize.

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers</span>

## Principles

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

## Understand

Try to think why the question is being asked.<br>
Don't take the message at face value.<br>
But sometimes do.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

## Ensure the message was understood

Don't stop at saying what you want, make sure the audience got it.

<span style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">Don't be the UDP.</span>


++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

## Adjust to the audience

Try to imagine how your message will be received

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

## Don't be a jerk

Formalities, conventions, smiles matter

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

### Language proficiency is less important than you think

Sophisticated language ~~can be detrimental to~~ is an enemy of efficient communication

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

### Brevity matters

The shorter the message, the bigger the chance it will be read in full.

<small>

> "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead."
> <br><small>~Mark Twain</small>

</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles » Brevity matters</span>

### Where brevity matters the most

* In code comments
* In documentation

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

### Communicate in the open

It's easier to ignore a message than to become a telepath

<small>DMs should be an exception, not the norm.</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles » Communicate in the open</span>

### Communicating in the open<br> is not easy

<small>

* Creates noise. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Requires a proper setup (e.g. slack channels) and mindset. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* People have natural tendency for private communication. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" data-fragment-index="3" -->

</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

### Effective communication is hard and costly

It's not always worth the effort

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>
