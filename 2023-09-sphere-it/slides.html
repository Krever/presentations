### Communication goal

<img src="resources/comm-model-3.mermaid.png">

_What you say_ and _What they hear_ don't matter in the end

++++

### Why this talk?

* Share a few tricks <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Talk about principles <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Increase awareness <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->

### Practice first

Principles later

##### Problem 1
## Estimates

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

### Is this a communication concern?

<pre style="width: 50%">
Q: When will this be done?
A: In around a week
</pre>

<div class="fragment">
    <small>What they understood: <i>It will be in prod for all the users in 1 week</i></small>
    <small>What you wanted to say: <i>I will open a PR in 1 week</i></small>
</div>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

#### The most important question

> Why do you need it?

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

#### Reasons for providing estimates

* Promise to regulator
* Promise to users
* Internal planning
* Prioritization
* ...
* **None**

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

### The goal

Provide a number with the same meaning for both sides

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

### Size vs time

<span style="font-size: 0.7em">
It's a separate topic.

Size is better but has limited uses.
</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Estimates</span>

### What to explicitly mention
When estimating release date

<small>

* Scope - what will be released and to whom <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Num of dev-days - how much work-time it will take <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Uncertainty factor - how confident we are about the work
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Assumed dev availability - how much time a single dev can devote
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Assumed dev assignment - how many devs will work on this
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Final date - by what date we expect the release <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* End result - what will be delivered <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Word "estimate" - in opposition to commitment <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->

</small>

++++

##### Problem 2
## Pull requests: Author

Get your PRs reviewed

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author</span>

### How not to ask for review

<img src="resources/bad-review-request.png">

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author</span>

### Find reviewers

Concrete people, groups work until they don't

As many as you need, but **not more**

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author</span>

### Put a deadline

Explicit date by which you want to merge

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author</span>

### Make it reviewer-friendly


++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author » Make it reviewer-friendly</span>

## Make it small

<img src="resources/pr-size-1.png">
<img src="resources/pr-size-2.png">
<img src="resources/pr-size-3.png">

<span style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">Hehe</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author » Make it reviewer-friendly</span>

### When small is not an option

* description - what the PR is about <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* highlights - the most important places to look at <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* remaining TODOs - to know what is not done yet <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Author » Make it reviewer-friendly</span>

### No force-push

<small>⚔️ rebase vs merge ⚔️</small>

##### Problem 3
## Pull requests: Reviewer

Give a good review

Don't make enemies

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Reviewer</span>

### The LOGAF Scale

Level Of Give A Fuck

<img src="resources/logaf.png">

<span style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">There is no standard</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Reviewer</span>

### Conventional comments

[conventionalcomments.org](https://conventionalcomments.org/)

<img src="resources/conventional-comments.png">

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Pull requests: Reviewer</span>

### Don't be a jerk

<small>

* propose solutions (e.g. new names)
* offer help (e.g. pair programming)
* show empathy (e.g. no one wants to fix stuff ad infinitum)
* pick your battles (not every issue is important, perfect doesn't exist)

</small>

##### Problem 4

## During implementation

<small>Code & work coordination</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>

### Business discussions

<small>
Part of the job is to be understood.

Limit amount of information.

Forbidden words: PR, commit, branch.

</small>

++++

<span class="" style="font-size: 2em">
    ADJUST CONTENT TO THE AUDIENCE
</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>

### Code comments

* Classic: why not what <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* Humor is valuable <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->
* It's a message into the future <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out	" -->

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>

### Leave breadcrumbs behind

<small>Pieces of context that will help in future investigations</small>

<div class="container">
    <div class="col" style="font-size: 0.7em">
        What? <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Slack links</li>
            <li>Jira links</li>
            <li>Stackoverflow links</li>
            <li>Github links</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col" style="font-size: 0.7em">
        Where? <br>
        <ul>
            <li>in Slack conversations</li>
            <li>in Jira issues</li>
            <li>in commit messages</li>
            <li>in PRs</li>
            <li>in comments</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

</div>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>

### Build in the open

You can never know who might be interested, who might be affected, and if it's not you who misses some context

<span style="font-size: 0.7em;color: gray">We will talk about this more later</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation » build in the open</span>

### Keep people in the loop

If you're irreplaceable, you've failed at your job.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation</span>
### Coordinating releases

<div class="container">
    <div class="col" style="font-size: 0.7em">
        It can be really complicated when multiple parties are involved.
        <small>Mobile, backend, marketing, legal, operations, etc.</small>
    </div>
</div>
<span style="font-size: 0.4em;color: gray">release ≠ deployment</span>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » During implementation » Coordinating releases</span>

#### Thread & emojis can be enough

<img src="resources/release-thread.png">

----

##### Problem 5

## Everyday communication

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication </span>

### Hello

Or rather [nohello.net](https://nohello.net)

<img src="resources/nohello.png"/>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication </span>

### Repeat, repeat, repeat

People will forget, miss messages or misinterpret. This is normal.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication </span>

### How to get a response

* Target your messages
* Explain why you need something
* Explain when you need it

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication » How to get a response</span>

### Target your messages

No explicit `@mention` - no response. Diffusion of responsibility steps in.

Ping someone even if you're not sure if they can help.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication » How to get a response</span>

### Explain why you need something

Xerox Study by Ellen Langer

Giving _any_ explanation changes the situation diametrically.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication » How to get a response</span>

### Explain when you need it

People will try to deliver by that date. Smaller chance of landing in "later" bucket.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication » How to get a response</span>

### Example

<img src="resources/get-response-example-bad.png">

vs.

<img src="resources/get-response-example-good.png">

notes:
Hey, where can I find CPU usage metrics? (edited)
Hey, I need to get CPU usage of our servers. Not sure who can help with this, maybe @tiago?
We are releasing a CPU heavy feature on Wednesday and I need to prepare the setup.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Give the responses you want to get

<small>

* if you don't know the answer but you know someone who might - ping them
* if you don't have time - say this
* if you plan to look at it later on - say this
* if you started looking at the problem at it might take time - say this

</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Adjust the tone

😊 Humans like smiles 😊

(Faked) over-enthusiasm can be worse than grumpiness.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Adjust the formatting

Messages should be easy to scan without reading. People are busy, most of them won't read a wall of text.

* Put `TL;DR` at the top
* Bolden the essence
* Use bullet points
* Don't over-do it

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Call or message

Meetings are costly, inconvenient, annoying and effective.

Heuristic: threads with more than 10 messages sent in an hour should be a call.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Everyday Communication</span>

### Be gentle with `@pings`

Use as little as possible but not less.

When pinging from long thread - summarize.

----

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers</span>

## Principles

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

## Ensure the message was received

Don't stop at saying what you want, make sure the audience got it

Don't be the UDP.

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

## Adjust to the audience

Try to imagine how your message will be received

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

## Don't be a jerk

Formalities, conventions, smiles matter

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

### Language proficiency is less important than you think

Sophisticated language ~~can be detrimental~~ is an enemy of efficient communication

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

### Brevity matters

The shorter the message, the bigger the chance it will be read in full.

<small>

> "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead."
> <br><small>~Mark Twain</small>

</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles » Brevity matters</span>

### Brevity matters a lot

* In code comments
* In documentation

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

### Communicate in the open

It's easier to ignore a message than to become a telepath

<small>DMs should be an exception, not the norm.</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles » Communicate in the open</span>

### It's not simple

<small>

* Creates noise.
* Requires a proper setup (e.g. channels) and mindset.
* People have natural tendency for private communication.

</small>

++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

#### Effective communication is hard and costly

It's not always worth the effort



++++

<span class="breadcrumb-data">Communication for Developers » Principles</span>

#### When you think you know enough
